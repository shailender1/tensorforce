        Args:
            states_spec: Dict containing at least one state definition. In the case of a single state,
               keys `shape` and `type` are necessary. For multiple states, pass a dict of dicts where each state
               is a dict itself with a unique name as its key.
            actions_spec: Dict containing at least one action definition. Actions have types and either `num_actions`
                for discrete actions or a `shape` for continuous actions. Consult documentation and tests for more.
            preprocessing: Optional list of preprocessors (e.g. `image_resize`, `grayscale`) to apply to state. Each
                preprocessor is a dict containing a type and optional necessary arguments.
            exploration: Optional dict specifying exploration type (epsilon greedy strategies or Gaussian noise)
                and arguments.
            reward_preprocessing: Optional dict specifying reward preprocessor using same syntax as state preprocessing.
            batched_observe: Optional int specifying how many observe calls are batched into one session run.
                Without batching, throughput will be lower because every `observe` triggers a session invocation to
                update rewards in the graph.
            batch_size: Int specifying batch size used to sample from memory. Should be smaller than memory size.
            memory: Dict describing memory via `type` (e.g. `replay`) and `capacity`.
            first_update: Int describing at which time step the first update is performed. Should be larger
                than batch size.
            update_frequency: Int specifying number of observe steps to perform until an update is executed.
            repeat_update: Int specifying how many update steps are performed per update, where each update step implies
                sampling a batch from the memory and passing it to the model.
