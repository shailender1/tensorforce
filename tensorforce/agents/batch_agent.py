        Args:
            states_spec: Dict containing at least one state definition. In the case of a single state,
               keys `shape` and `type` are necessary. For multiple states, pass a dict of dicts where each state
               is a dict itself with a unique name as its key.
            actions_spec: Dict containing at least one action definition. Actions have types and either `num_actions`
                for discrete actions or a `shape` for continuous actions. Consult documentation and tests for more.
            preprocessing: Optional list of preprocessors (e.g. `image_resize`, `grayscale`) to apply to state. Each
                preprocessor is a dict containing a type and optional necessary arguments.
            exploration: Optional dict specifying exploration type (epsilon greedy strategies or Gaussian noise)
                and arguments.
            reward_preprocessing: Optional dict specifying reward preprocessor using same syntax as state preprocessing.
            batched_observe: Optional int specifying how many observe calls are batched into one session run.
                Without batching, throughput will be lower because every `observe` triggers a session invocation to
                update rewards in the graph.
            batch_size: Int specifying number of samples collected via `observe` before an update is executed.
